## Abstract

This data uses the US 2020 Census results that is in the Harvard Database in order to analyse if there is a correltaion between the election numbers in 2020 and other factors. The factors include immigration status, gender, birth year, and results from the 2016 election. It was found that there does exist a correlation between the outcomes of the 2020 election and the above variables. These are important results as the US is a country that si considered a hub, due to all the external relations they have with multiple countries. These results will also help predict who may win the 2024 elections.
